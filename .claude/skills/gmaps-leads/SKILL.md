# Google Maps Lead Generation

## Goal
Generate high-quality B2B leads from Google Maps with deep contact enrichment by scraping websites and using Claude to extract structured contact data.

## Inputs
| Parameter | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `--search` | Yes | Search query (e.g., "plumbers in Austin TX") |
| `--limit` | No | Max results (default: 10) |
| `--sheet-url` | No | Existing sheet to append to |
| `--workers` | No | Parallel workers (default: 3) |

## Scripts
- `./scripts/gmaps_lead_pipeline.py` - Main orchestration
- `./scripts/gmaps_parallel_pipeline.py` - Parallel version
- `./scripts/scrape_google_maps.py` - Google Maps scraper
- `./scripts/extract_website_contacts.py` - Website contact extractor
- `./scripts/update_sheet.py` - Google Sheets sync

## Process

### Basic Usage
```bash
# Create new sheet with 10 leads
python3 ./scripts/gmaps_lead_pipeline.py --search "plumbers in Austin TX" --limit 10

# Append to existing sheet (recommended for building database)
python3 ./scripts/gmaps_lead_pipeline.py --search "dentists in Miami FL" --limit 25 \
  --sheet-url "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/..."

# Higher volume
python3 ./scripts/gmaps_lead_pipeline.py --search "roofing contractors in Austin TX" \
  --limit 50 --workers 5
```

## Pipeline Steps

1. **Google Maps Scrape** - Apify `compass/crawler-google-places` returns listings
2. **Website Scraping** - Fetches main page + up to 5 contact pages
3. **Web Search Enrichment** - DuckDuckGo search for owner contact info
4. **Claude Extraction** - Claude 3.5 Haiku extracts structured contacts
5. **Google Sheet Sync** - Appends new leads, deduplicates by lead_id

## Output Schema (36 fields)

**Business Basics:** business_name, category, address, city, state, zip_code, phone, website, rating, review_count

**Extracted Contacts:** emails, additional_phones, business_hours

**Social Media:** facebook, twitter, linkedin, instagram, youtube, tiktok

**Owner Info:** owner_name, owner_title, owner_email, owner_phone, owner_linkedin

**Team Contacts:** JSON array of team members

**Metadata:** lead_id, scraped_at, search_query, pages_scraped, enrichment_status

## Cost
| Component | Per Lead |
|-----------|----------|
| Apify Google Maps | ~$0.01-0.02 |
| Claude Haiku | ~$0.002 |
| DuckDuckGo/HTTP | Free |
| **Total** | **~$0.012-0.022** |

For 100 leads: ~$1.50-2.50 total

## Troubleshooting

- **"No businesses found"**: Include location in query
- **403 Forbidden**: ~10-15% of sites block scrapers (handled gracefully)
- **Auth issues**: Delete `token.json` and re-authenticate
- **Duplicates**: Uses lead_id (MD5 of name|address) for deduplication

## Environment
```
APIFY_API_TOKEN=your_token
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key
```
